# Machine_learning_projects
This repository contain different Exploratory Data Analysis , Data Visualization and prediction , classification and clustering of Data using python Libraries and Machine Learning algorithms
## 1. Flight Fare Prediction 
* dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh?select=Data_Train.xlsx
* Notebook contains in-depth insight into Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization and Data Preparation.
* This [Notebook](https://github.com/patelom5917/Machine_learning_projects/blob/master/Flight%20Fare%20Prediction.ipynb) contains method for feature selection based on correlation with target attribute.
* Tried different algorithms for regression and got ~80% accuracy using RandomForestRegressor.

## 2. Boston House Prediction
* dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices?select=housing.csv
* In this [Notbook](https://github.com/patelom5917/Machine_learning_projects/blob/master/Boston%20house%20price%20prediction.ipynb) i perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization and at the end i applied many machine learning algorithm to predict house price 
* And i got highest accuracy around 73% and it's good for regression and i got that accuracy using GradientBoostingRegressor

## 3. Credit Card Fraud Classification
* dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?select=creditcard.csv
* In this [Notbook](https://github.com/patelom5917/Machine_learning_projects/blob/master/Credit%20card%20fraud%20detection-1.ipynb) i perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization, Apply Under Sampling, Over Sampling, HyperParameter tuning, Outlier Handling and at the end i applied many machine learning algorithm to classify Credit card transaction is Fraud or Non-Fraud 
* I have uploaded two version of this project
* Version 1: In this Version I apply Under Sampling to balance data and I got highest Recall Score: 0.92, Precision Score: 0.98, F1 Score: 0.95, Accuracy Score: 0.95 and i got that accuracy using two algorithm SVC and Logistic Regression
